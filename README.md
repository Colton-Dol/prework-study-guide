# Prework-Study-Guide-Webpage

## Description

I enrolled in a bootcamp about coding and there's a lot of information thrown at you before classes even begin, so I built this website to help me, and others, keep track of a couple of the things taught in the prework. This website contains notes on HTML, CSS, git, and JavaScript.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

The website displays different sections, each containing notes for a different topic: HTML, CSS, git, and JavaScript. By inspecting the webpage and opening the DevTools console you can also see JavaScript at work. You can also press Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows) to open up the console. It will list each topic learned as well as suggest one to study first.
